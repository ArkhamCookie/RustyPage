## Coding

### Setup Your Rust Environment

1. Install Rust using [Rustup](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/)
2. Make sure Rust is up to date by running `rustup update`

### New to a Language

If you are new to any of the coding languages used in this project,
I have made a small section for each language to help get you started.

#### New to HTML

If you are new to HTML and want a good runthrough of the basics of HTML,
you can try the [W3 Schools HTML tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/).

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) is a great resource for looking up how specific parts of the web work.

If you want a full course to the frontend languages of the web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript),
you can check out [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) and/or [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

#### New to CSS

#### New to Rust

If you are new to Rust,
I **highly** recommend going though [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).

## Writing Documentation

*Ironically, this section still needs to be written.*

## Financially

Last, *but certainly not least,* you can support the project financially by donating to me, [@ArkhamCookie](https://github.com/ArkhamCookie).

### Direct Donation

You can really help me by sending a donation my way.
I love open source and creating projects to share with the world,
and I hope to make it my full time job eventually.

Even a "small" amount, like one dollar, goes a long way;
both to feed my cookie addiction and help motivate me.
There's nothing quite like knowing someone enjoys your work.

You can find me on:

- [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/ArkhamCookie)
- [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/ArkhamCookie)
- [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/arkhamcookie)

The **best way** is through [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/ArkhamCookie) because they take a 0% fee of all donations, memberships, commissions, etc.
No matter how you choice to support me, I greatly appreciate it.

### Hire Me

I currently do freelance work.
If you are in need of a developer,
contact me at [hire-me@mail.theuntitledproject.dev](mailto:hire-me@mail.theuntitledproject.dev).

I am always looking for new people to work with and new problems to solve.

#### Website

Speaking of freelance work, one of the things I commonly do is design websites.
If you are a fan of my work and want something in return,
hiring me to design your website is a great way to support me.

I can set up hosting on the hosting provider of your choice,
or I set you up on a site, like GitHub, for free hosting.
